           <p>Hey everyone! My name is Seth Childers. I am a Computer Science Major and am ephasising in Web Development. As you can see, I come from a large family where I fall as the fourth of seven children.</p>
           <p>Currently I live in Rexburg, ID as I am here at school, but my family resides in Camas, WA (Go Papermakers!).</p>
           <p>I look forward to learning with all of you this semester!</p>
